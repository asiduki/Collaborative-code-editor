Dependencies
--------------------
Ignore the node_modules directory, which stores all the project's dependencies.
This folder can become very large and can be recreated by running npm install.
node_modules/

Lockfiles
--------------------
While some teams commit package-lock.json to ensure consistent dependency versions
across all environments, you've requested to ignore it. This might be desired
if you want developers to get the latest compatible versions on install.
package-lock.json

Environment Variables
--------------------
Ignore environment variables files. These files often contain sensitive information
like API keys, database passwords, and other secrets that should never be
committed to version control.
